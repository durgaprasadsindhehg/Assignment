      <h2>Mitchell Starc</h2>

      <p>
        Mitchell Starc has made himself available for the 2024 IPL a long time
        ago and all the teams want to sign him. He is the best left arm fast
        bowler in the world and the pace and accuracy he has is simply
        incredible. He had stellar performances in the 2023 World Cup Semi final
        and final and was an important member of the winning team. He can also
        bat lower down the order as he has shown in the semi final of the World
        Cup by winning such a high pressure match for Australia.

      <h2>Pat Cummins</h2>

      <p>
        The 2023 World Cup winning captain will also be on high demand. In 2023
        alone Pat Cummins won the World Test Championship, Retained the Ashes
        and won the 2023 ODI World Cup. He is among the best fast bowlers in the
        world and he will be bought for a lot of money. A few teams might be
        looking for an overseas fast bowler but also a solid backup in the
        leadership department. He can also bat lower down the order as was
        visible 2 seasons ago when he made 2 mind blowing half centuries for
        KKR.
