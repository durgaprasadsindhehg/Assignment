    Whey is a quick-digesting protein that should be consumed within an hour after your last set to jumpstart protein synthesis. “Along with muscle repair and recovery, whey has the ability to do things like increase energy, help with depression, and benefit the hair and skin,” Lynn explains.
    And with whey, it pays to pay up. “If you’re not paying around $25 or so per pound, you’re probably not getting a high-quality whey,” she adds. “As expensive as it seems, a jug that costs $53 only comes out to $1.87 per serving. Plus, many cheaper whey proteins are the leftover junk that got rejected.”

<h1><Li>Creatine</Li></h1>

<p>
    Creatine, which is naturally found in red meat and fish, can provide the body with energy and translate to muscle growth and improved athletic performance.
    “Creatine is scientifically proven to help you increase strength, which means it allows you to pack on muscle faster than any other supplement,” Lynn says. “Look for a high-quality, quick-absorbing creatine from a brand name you can trust. Just like with whey, if you buy a cheap brand, expect a cheap product.”
