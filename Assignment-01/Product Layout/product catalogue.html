        Sustainability
        At Flipkart, our goal is to use the power of our platform for the good of people and our planet. We are driven by a mission to fulfil our responsibility to the planet and the society as we maximise our efforts to build value for the Indian consumer.
        As an early adopter of sustainability in the e-commerce space in India, our endeavour has been to embed sustainability across business strategies and functions. In these past couple of years, we have focused on creating a systems change through thought leadership and effective partnerships to create long term and sustained impact.
        We are investing in continued efforts towards developing a responsible value chain with a focus on mitigating our climate change impact through various supply chain initiatives including adoption of renewable energy, sustainable packaging, electric mobility, waste management, water stewardship and supplier engagement. As e-commerce disrupts the way people shop, our ambition is to involve all our brands and businesses in building a sustainable platform that provides our consumers with trusted ways to shop more sustainably.
        Through our powerful partnerships with communities, civil society organisations, and coalitions, we seek to drive positive impact with ecosystem conversations, enable cross learning and contribute to building a sustainable future for all. As we start our journey, we know that it would not be easy. We believe that it is important to develop a culture of sustainability where we can bring everyone together through our journey.
