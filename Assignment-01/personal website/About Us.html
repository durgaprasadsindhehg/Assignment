        "My passion for engineering takes me back to the memories of my childhood when engineering subconsciously became part of my life, and with time part of who I am. I was always captivated by the way things work, from dismantling my own toys to playing with Lego to turn my ideas into reality. Throughout the years Iâ€™ve nurtured this inborn passion and started maintaining my first car. I looked deeply into machines around me; learning new things day-by-day, researching and staying up-to-date with as many new engineering technologies as I can."

        "My first official step towards establishing my career was obtaining a mechanical engineering degree in a renowned university such as Texas A&M University, providing me with world class education; with both the practical and theoretical basis of it. My thorough study of solid mechanics, thermo fluids, automated control systems, system dynamics, vibrational analysis , and engineering codes of ethics has deepened my passion and knowledge about engineering. The courses I completed not only improved my learning skills but also reflected my solid academic performance."
