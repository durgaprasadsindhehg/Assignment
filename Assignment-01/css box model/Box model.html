          Slow but steady wins the race is a phrase that means slow, productive
          progress leads to success, as in We take your time to build this house
          right. Remember, slow but steady wins the race! You’re likely to hear
          Slow but steady wins the race when someone thinks doing something
          slowly but skillfully is better because it helps to avoid
          mistakes.You’re less likely to hear this phrase when you are on a
          tight deadline. Speed rather than quality become more important during
          those times.Slow and steady wins the race is a variation of this
          phrase.Example: You have more than enough time to finish the final
          exam. Slow but steady wins the race.

          This right-hand top-order batter hails from Nagpur, and was born on 30
          April 1987 as the eldest son of Gurunath and Purnima Sharma. Rohit
          spent his childhood with his grandfather due to financial difficulties
          at home. His uncle Manohar Sharma was the first to take note of his
          interest in cricket and enrolled for coaching at the age of 11.From
          then, there was no looking back for this prodigy. He soon grabbed a
          scholarship and changed schools. Rohit’s impressive Ranji Trophy
          record brought him to ODI cricket in 2007. His stupendous performances
          at IPL also helped him find a permanent place in the team.Despite
          being badly injured a few times, the talented player returned to the
          team with extra energy. Today, this 34-year-old is the owner of
          innumerable records, including three double centuries in ODI format.
          Team Mumbai Indians have won five titles under the captaincy of Rohit.
          His promotion from vice-captain to captain in the Indian cricket team
          is the result of sheer hard work and perseverance.
